Barcode Generator for PHP
=========================

Perhaps the biggest issue I encountered when creating an inventory management
system for a client was the fact that there was no unified framework for 
barcode generation in PHP that was reasonable in price, much less Open Source.
I hope to fill this gaping hole in the market today with Barcode Generator for
PHP.
